          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>King County is a crime noir comic set in Seattle in an undisclosed time in the future. It follows Paul Bradford, a former corrupt cop turned PI who is in bed with seemingly every criminal element in the Universal District of Seattle. While investigating the disappearance of a teenage girl, Bradford must bob and weave around a local triad he owes money to. His pursuers are led by Billy Vu, an up and coming lieutenant at the street level of the triad. King County begins with their story.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          King County takes place in an unkind future where the division between rich and poor has grown exponentially. To compund things, the elites and uber talents have left Earth behind in pursuit of better lives on new worlds that have been developed to the point of comfort, leaving the choice of staying on Earth undesirable.</p>
