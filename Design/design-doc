My final project will revolve around a comic book I have been working on for some time.  My plan is to have a landing page with some art as well as a description that is hidden until you hover over a portion of the site.  I will have several hidden portions like that that expand on clicking like we learned in the DOM manipulation assignment.    I am still mapping out which JS tools I will need to make this work.  But I want a big image up top and then a nice dark background drawn image of Seattle to write on (the story takes place in Seattle an undisclosed amount of time in the future).  
I’m going to need some links to other pages with a cast of characters and some panel examples of completed art.  Maybe a javascript code to play some audio?  That could be cool.  In the cast of characters, text boxes that pop up when you hover over the pictures maybe with a bio of the character.  I’ll use a third party grid tool to layout the image array.
I’ll have a login form that could sign up a user for an email list when they register.  I’ll also have a nav bar that bounces you around the site.
